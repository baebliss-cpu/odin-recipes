<!-- Description starts here-->
    <p>A chocolate brownie or simply a brownie is a chocolate baked confection. Brownies come in a variety of forms and may be either fudgy or cakey, <br> depending on their density. Brownies often, but not always, have a glossy "skin" on their upper crust. They may also include nuts, frosting, <br> cream cheese, chocolate chips, or other ingredients.</p>
