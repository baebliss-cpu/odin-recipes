        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Use about 1 tablespoon of the melted butter to grease a 7x11-inch baking dish.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add onions to the hot oil and cook, stirring frequently, until onions are soft and beginning to turn clear, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and add spinach. Stir spinach into the onions, breaking up any large clumps.</li>
            <li>Stir together flour, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Combine milk and eggs in a small bowl, whisking until milk and eggs are fully incorporated. Drizzle in remaining melted butter, while continuing to stir. Add to flour mixture and stir until there are no lumps.</li>
            <li>Fold in spinach mixture, French herbs, feta cheese, and mozzarella. Do not over-mix. Pour into the prepared dish, using a spatula to smooth and level the surface. Sprinkle grated Pecorino Romano evenly over the top.</li>
            <li>Bake in the center of the preheated oven until the top is browned, 40 to 45 minutes. Test for doneness with a wooden pick inserted into the middle. The dish is done, if the pick comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Allow to cool for 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Cut into 18 brownies and garnish with fresh parsley to serve.</li>
        </ol>
